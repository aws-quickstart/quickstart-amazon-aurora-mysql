.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, an Aurora database (DB) cluster in a security group, including one DB reader and one DB writer.
* An Amazon CloudWatch alarm to monitor the CPU on the bastion host and send alarm notifications using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
* An encryption key using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The key enables encryption at rest for the Aurora DB cluster.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
