==== Requirements for deploying Aurora into an existing VPC

If you plan to deploy Aurora into an existing VPC, check the following:

* Your VPC must have two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the database
instances. This Partner Solution does not support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^].
* To download packages and software without exposing instances to the internet, the private subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables.
* The domain name must be configured in the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^].
* You must have a Linux bastion host to run the tests discussed in the link:#_test_the_deployment[Test the deployment] section. To install the bastion host, launch the https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-linux-bastion/blob/main/templates/linux-bastion.template[AWS CloudFormation template^] that we provide for an existing subnet. When you launch the Partner Solution, you are prompted for your VPC settings.

If you donâ€™t have an existing VPC that satisfies these requirements, use the new-VPC deployment option so that the Partner Solution builds a VPC for you in addition to deploying {partner-product-short-name}.
