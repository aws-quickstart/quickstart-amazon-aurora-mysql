==== Requirements for deploying Aurora into an existing VPC

If you plan to deploy Aurora into an existing VPC, check the following:

* Your VPC must have two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the database
instances. This Quick Start does not support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^].
* To download packages and software without exposing instances to the internet, the private subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables.
* The domain name must be configured in the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^].
* You must have a Linux bastion host to run the tests discussed in the link:#_test_the_deployment[Test the deployment] section. To install the bastion host, launch the https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-linux-bastion/blob/master/templates/linux-bastion.template[AWS CloudFormation template^] that we provide for an existing subnet. When you launch the Quick Start, you are prompted for your VPC settings.

If you don’t have an existing VPC that satisfies these requirements, use the new-VPC deployment option so that the Quick Start builds a VPC for you in addition to deploying {partner-product-short-name}.
