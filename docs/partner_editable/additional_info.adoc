== Test the deployment

To test the deployment, confirm that the MySQL database is accepting connections by following these steps.

. Download the latest version of https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/[MySQL Workbench^], and install it on the workstation from which you will be connecting to the Aurora MySQL DB cluster. 
. From the AWS CloudFormation console, on the BastionStack *Outputs* tab, note the value for `EIP1`, as shown in <<additional1>>.

[start=3]
. From the AWS CloudFormation console, on the AuroraStack *Outputs* tab, note the values of `DBName`, `DBMasterUsername`, `AuroraClusterEndpoint`, and `AuroraClusterPort`, as shown in <<additional2>>.

[start=4]
. Create an SSH tunnel to the bastion host using the following command, filling in the values for the bracketed terms. For <KeyPairName>, enter the path for the EC2 key pair that you specified for the `KeyPairName` parameter while creating the AWS CloudFormation stack.
+
----
ssh -N -L <AuroraClusterPort>:<AuroraClusterEndpoint>:<AuroraClusterPort> ec2-user@EIP1 -i <KeyPairName>
----
+
A message appears indicating that you've connected to the bastion host.
+
[start=5]
. Launch MySQL Workbench on your workstation.
. On the *Database* menu, choose *Connect to Database*, as shown in <<additional3>>.

. Enter the following in the *Connect to Database* dialog box, shown in <<additional4>>.
.. In the *Hostname* field, enter *127.0.0.1*
.. In *Port* field, enter the value for the `AuroraClusterPort` parameter.
.. In *Username*, enter the value for the `DBMasterUsername` parameter.
.. Choose *OK*.

[start=8]
. In the *Connect to MySQL Server* dialog box, shown in <<additional5>>, enter the `DBMasterUserPassword` password you entered during stack creation. If the `RotateDBPassword` parameter was set to *true* during stack creation, the master password for Aurora MySQL was rotated after creation. In this case, retrieve the new password as follows:
.. From the AWS CloudFormation console, on the AuroraStack *Outputs* tab, note the values for `AuroraMasterUserSecret`.
.. On the AWS Secrets Manager console, choose the secret you noted above.
.. Choose *Retrieve Secret Value*, and copy the password.
